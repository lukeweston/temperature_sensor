Quick, simple 10ÂµA bias for Lakeshore DT-670 temperature sensor

Expected diode voltage 1.5785V at 4.2K

(Helium head temperature will depend on compression, in closed-loop cryocooler.)

A precision benchtop voltmeter is preferred for voltage readout.

Temperature range 1.4K - 420K (500K for some, depends on Lakeshore packaging type)
